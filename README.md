# MLB On Flask

## Description
This is MLB on Flask: a simple yet exciting two-player baseball game that includes real MLB teams, real MLB players, and real MLB stats. A Flask web app playable in a web browser.

## Motivation
If you're a fan of quick, easy-to-play games or a baseball fan (or both!), MLB on Flask is for you. We've brought America's pastime to your browser, and built it so that anyone can play. You can pick your favorite team, hit as your favorite player, view updated player stats and photos, and more.

This game was developed in part to learn three tiered architecture, how to build an efficient REST API, and how to design and effectively integrate PostgreSQL databases. It also became a great opportunity to learn Git and what collaboration looks like between backend and frontend developers.

## Quick Start
**If the reader is interested enough in the "what" and the "why", now it's time to show them "how"! This section should be the *minimum amount of information* they need to run your project.**

**This section doesn't talk about how to build the project, how to contribute to it, or explain every individual feature included. This is about *using* it, and using it quickly. This section should make it super easy to use the game, or at least super easy to see how it would be used.**

Put gameplay URL hyperlink here once game is fully deployed to AWS.

## Usage
**Get technical with the description! This is where you want to brag about any advanced features or special things that your app does. Show off all the cool stuff that you built!**

From the POV of anyone simply playing the game, what are all the cool technical features?

## Contributing
From the POV of, say, a developer interested in building their own frontend client for the game, or actually pulling down/cloning the code and running it themselves. How would they go about doing that? What do they need to know? A  hiring manager may want to poke around in the code, play with it, explore it, etc, and you want to make sure you include code snippets about how they would do that (i.e. clone the repo, run the app (see instructions below), run tests [still need to do this], submit a pull request, etc...)

**Make sure instructions are super explicit and clear, so it's impossible for someone reading it to mess up.**



## Getting Started
To start project

Create a virtual environment. 

If no virtual environment is installed, you can install VSCode Python extension from Microsoft, and start a virtual environment in the vscode terminal.

Install the requirements.txt file on prompt. 

use the command `flask --app wsgi.py run --debug` in the virtual environment to start app in debug mode

App will start on localhost:5000 if available
